            <p><span class="numb">2</span>. Blow your nose with a beer
                Sapporo commissioned a study that found that one of the chemicals in hops has anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, as well the ability to combat the respiratory syncytial virus. Unfortunately Fortunately Unfortunately you'd need to drink 30 cans' worth in order for the small amounts of the chemical to truly have an effect. But, you know, if it is for science...</p>

                <p><span class="numb">3</span>. The great beer belly lie
                    Nutritionist Dr. Kathryn Oâ€™Sullivan exposed the invalidity of the wide-reaching myth of the beer belly with a study built upon the foundation that beer contains fewer calories than orange juice, liquor, or wine. So, although excessive consumption will obviously pork up a midsection, habitual OJ use would be even worse.</p>

                    <p><span class="numb">4</span>. Defense against fire hazards
                        If you don't have a fire extinguisher handy, a shaken bottle of beer sprayed on fire is nearly as effective at putting out flames because it's mostly water. FireScienceSchools.org lists it at number eight on their list of fire-extinguishing tools, right between sand and urine.</p>

                        <p><span class="numb">5</span>. I heart beer
                            The Italian researchers at Fondazione di Ricerca e Cura analyzed the data behind the drinking habits of 200k people and found that moderate beer drinkers are generally more awesome have a 31% reduction in risk of heart disease, which is roughly the same as wine drinkers.</p>

                            <p><span class="numb">6</span>. Bone bonus
                                UC Davis researchers concluded that beer contains a ton of silicon, which, in addition to contributing to parts of the anatomy that might give one a bone, also increases bone density at a higher rate than wine. However, if you have more than two beers, it actually weakens your skeletal system and makes fractures more likely. Although, it's unclear if the fracture fact accounts for the correlation between decreased coordination and increased tendency to attempt "the worm".</p>

                                    The University of Indiana (the Hoos-who of research institutions) measured dopamine levels after subjects were given tablespoon samples of beer or Gatorade. The small serving was intended to nullify the effects of the alcohol and isolate the taste alone. Even subjects who reported preferring the taste of Gatorade saw their happiness sensors react much more intensely to the beer.</p>
